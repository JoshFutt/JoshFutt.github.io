	<p>When evaluating international education, it is important to leave your biases behind. What you may have heard or concluded yourself may not necessarily be true. There are many ways to evaluate education, but there isn ‘t one result or conclusion that can be drawn from those evaluations. Presented here, are three ways that most would choose as a way to judge the success/failures of a countries education.

<h3><center><u>Type of Education System </h3></u> </center>
<p>
Three out of the five highest achieving students are also on the list of unhappiest students. That may not be so surprising, but only one of those three countries has a strict education system. </p>

<p>South Korea, Finland, and Estonia are all high achieving countries with low student satisfaction.  In South Korea, students are usually at school by 7AM and don’t finish until around 10PM. This is because many students take after academies called “Hagwons,” for subjects such as English, Math, and Piano.Students frequently develop nearsightedness from hours of studying. There are many state regulated tests and pressure is high. </p>

<p>On the opposite end of that spectrum is Finland. Finland has a “Non Traditional” education system, where student involvement is high, and pressure is lower. Students in Finland do not take frequent tests. There is only one state test at the age of 16. Students get 75 minutes of recess a day, and teachers only teach for around 4 hours. </P>

<p>In Estonia, students are encouraged to pursue their hobbies/passion. Vocational training is common after the age of 16, and students are not graded to heavily.</p>

<p>The worst performing countries seem to have a higher level of happiness. Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Turkey, all are on the bottom in terms of overall student education. Indonesia, which is on the very bottom of the list, has the highest student satisfaction rate. 

	<p> Note - 4/5 of the countries on that list are not official OECD countries, because their development is not high enough. This means that their education is also not developed enough to even take the PISA tests used to determine student achievement. </P>

<h4><center><u>Result/Conclusion</h4></u> </center>

<p>If you are rating happiness by education system, you won’t find a satisfying conclusion. If you were to judge education simply by happiness, the only education students seem to enjoy, is a lack thereof education. </p>

<p> <i> <center> As you can see by this chart, the higher the student achievement, the lower the happiness.</center> </i> </p>

<h5> <u> <center> GDP Spent on Education </h5> </u> </center>

<p>Another seemingly logical way to judge an education system is the amount of GDP the country spends on their education. Looking again at the top performing countries and the lowest performing countries, you will see that in some circumstances there is a correlation. </p>

<p> Indonesia and Turkey, both on the list of students with low achievement, spend very little on their GDP. Indonesia spends 2.8%, and Turkey spends 2.9%, much lower than the average GDP spent on education of 4.3%. </p>

<p>All five of the top performing countries spends at least 5.0% with Finland and Estonia at 5.7%. </p>

<p> Brazil and Mexio, both extremely low performing countries, both spend above 5.0%. Brazil spend 5.8% but still is on the bottom. </p>

<p>GDP is not a correct way to determine student achievement or happiness. A country can spend as much money as they want on education, but if that money isn’t used properly/effectively, students education won’t improve, therefore, GDP on education is not a correct way to determine student achievement. </p>

<P><i> <center> As you can see, Brazil spend 5.8% of their GDP on education </center> </i></P>

<p> <i> <center> Finland spends 5.7%, but the impact is higher </i> </center> </P>

<h7> <u> <center> Emotional Needs </h7> </u> </center>

<p>The third way to determine student achievement and happiness logically could be how well student’s social and emotional needs are being met. This also proves false. </p>

<p>The top 5 countries where students say their social &emotional needs are being met by percentage are (approximatly) as follows</p>

<p> <b> Indonesia at 88%, Poland  at 88% , Thailand at 88%, Malaysia at 86%, Albania at 86%, </b> </p>

<p> It is interesting because Indonesia, Thailand, and Albania are all on the list of happiest students. Once again if you follow a logical path you would decide that students are happiest in countries where their emotional needs are being met, even if that comes at the expense of a good education. Once again this can be proven untrue. </p>

<p> Poland, is on the list of highest achieving countries where, according to this list, there social and emotional needs are being met. However, Poland is also rated 7th to last by student happiness. </p>

<h8> <u> <center> Result/Conclusion </h8> </u> </center>

<p> Although it seems to make sense that students are happiest when their social & emotional needs are being met, Poland proves students can still be unhappy in that situation. </p>

<p> As you can see in this chart, the higher a students happiness is, the lower the achievement. </p>

<center> <img src= http://joshfuttersak.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/LINE2.png HEIGHT="600" WIDTH="900" BORDER="1"> </center>

<p> As you can see in this chart, when you add in the "happiness" factor, everything changes and becomes more muddled </p>

<p> <h9> <center> <u> CONCLUSION </u> </p> </h9> </center>

<p> There is not one correct way to judge an education system. We still have a long way to go in determining what helps students learn well, while keeping them happy and making sure their emotional needs are met. </p>
